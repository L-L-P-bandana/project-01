              About Story Valley
            </h3>
            <p class="generic-paragraph about-paragraph paragraph w-75">
            Story Valley uses visual, audio, and digital materials to help reinterpret student stories by combining oral history and 
            innovative, creative literacy techniques.Students come together from different backgrounds and cultures and work together to 
            practice their English, their national language and to learn about each other's culture.
            </p>
            <p class="generic-paragraph about-paragraph paragraph w-75">
            We aim to inspire students to read, write and speak in different languages, and to use their creativity to translate their 
            stories to new media and platforms. This way, students will be able to strengthen their key competences in literacy and 
            language in an engaging and creative way.
            </p>
            <p class="generic-paragraph about-paragraph paragraph w-75">
            In the approach of using oral history as a driving force, we use an interdisciplinary way of learning to contribute to several 
            European key priorities such as raising awareness of european cultures value in society, strengthening competencies, and integrating
            migrant cultures by respecting their backgrounds, and sharing our own.
            </p>
