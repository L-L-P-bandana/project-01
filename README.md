# project-01 - Story Valley

This project was created for my first trimesters' web tech evaluation in the third year of attending Napier Univercity. It contains a blog website cenetered around sharing 
the traditional folk tales of ye' ol' Europe taht have been passed down through our combined liniage, in a hopes of keeping them alive, and preserving the cultures that
gave them life.
